# MH_Inequity_Trends_EITC
This repository hosts analytic scripts for an ongoing project examining whether State Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) policies have modified national trends in intersectional mental health inequities between 2000 and 2019.

To answer these questions, we use repeated cross-sectional data from the 2000-2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and adopt an inter-categorical and non-parametric approach, estimating population trends over time across social groups defined individually and intersectionally by race and ethnicity, perceived sex, and household poverty status. We further examine whether these trends have been modified by Federal and State Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) policy availability, receipt, and generosity.
